# Pare Down for Spotify
Do you have one or more big playlists (+1000 songs) and your mobile data is limited? If so, you can use Pare Down for Spotify to create copy of selected playlist with amount of songs you've choosen to. Now you can download smaller version of your playlist and still enjoy your music without worrying about data limit.

## üìñ How to use Pare Down:
* First you need to login with your Spotify account and grant Pare Down app permission to access some of your data (more about it [here](#For-users)).
* After granting permission you will be redirect to page with list of all of your playlists (you can see there name, cover and total number of songs in playlist).
* Now, you need to select one of the displayed playlists by clicking on it - which will redirect you to another step where you can customize order and number of songs in playlist that will be created by Pare Down.
* After clicking "CREATE NEW PLAYLIST" button you will see another step:
On left you can see information about playlist you have selected (name, num of songs and cover) and on right you can see information about playlist that will be created after this step. If you're happy with your choices you need to click "CREATE" button, if not - by clicking "CANCEL" button you will be redirect back to step1 where you can select same or another playlist..
* If you choose to "CREATE", you will be redirect to last step, where you will see information about successful creation of playlist and button to pare down another playlist if you want to. :)

**Q:** I clicked on 'LOG IN WITH SPOTIFY" button but it didn't immediately redirect me to log in page, why?\
**A:** Service that is responsible for redirection of users is designed to 'go to sleep' after 30 minutes of inactivity, because Pare Down is not used by a lot of people it can 'go to sleep' quite often and it takes couple of seconds for this service to fully 'wake up'.

### To test Pare Down locally you need to do couple of things:
**For frontend:**
* run `npm start` in root directory of this project.
* now you can go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* but to be available to get *Log in with Spotify* button to work you need to get backend working...

**For backend:**
* you need to go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and then:
	* Create new app
	* Edit 'Redirect URIs' setting of it to `http://localhost:8888/callback`
	* Copy `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET` of it from that page.
* and then in terminal use this 2 commands:\
`export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=[id you copied]`\
`export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=[other id you copied]`
* and finally run `npm start` in backend folder.
* Now *Log in with Spotify* button should work. Also you can test it by going to [http://localhost:8888/login](http://localhost:8888/login)
