# Pare Down for Spotify
Do you have one or more big playlists (+1000 songs) and your mobile data is limited? If so, you can use Pare Down for Spotify to create copy of selected playlist with amount of songs you've choosen to. Now you can download smaller version of your playlist and still enjoy your music without worrying about data limit.

## üìñ How to use Pare Down:
* First you need to login with your Spotify account and grant Pare Down app permission to access some of your data (more about it here).
* After granting permission you will be redirect to page with list of all of your playlists (you can see there name, cover and total number of songs in playlist).
* Now, you need to select one of the displayed playlists by clicking on it - which will redirect you to another page where you can customize order and number of songs in playlist that will be created by Pare Down.
* After clicking "CREATE NEW PLAYLIST" button you will see another page:
On left you can see information about playlist you have selected (name, num of songs and cover) and on right you can see information about playlist that will be created after this step. If you're happy with your choices you need to click "CREATE" button, if not - by clicking "CANCEL" button you will be redirect back to step1 where you can select same or another playlist..
* If you choose to "CREATE", you will be redirect to last page, where you will see information about successful creation of playlist and button to pare down another playlist if you want to. :)
